# Web-Automation
This script will automate the turning in of assignments for the courses specified on your local machine. 
The script will look at a main directory that contains all the courses with sub-directories for each course. The 
sub-directories will contain the assignments to submit. The program can be run each time to submit the intended assignment. 
This script relies on Selenium to automate the submisison process.
